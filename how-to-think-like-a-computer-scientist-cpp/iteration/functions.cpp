/**
 *
 * some of the reasons functions are useful:
 * 1. By giving a name to a sequence of statements, youo make your program easier to read and debug.
 * 2. Dividing a long program into functions allows you to separate parts of teh program, debug tehem in
 * isolation, and then compose them into a whole.
 * 3. Functions facilitate both recursion and iteration.
 * 4. Well-desikgned functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.
