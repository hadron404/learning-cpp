/*
 * algorithms: a set of instructions for solving a class of problems by a mechanical,unintelligent process.
 * When you write a general solution for a class of problems, as opposed to a sepecific solution to a single problem,
 * you have written an algorithm.
 *
 * One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out.
 * The are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.
