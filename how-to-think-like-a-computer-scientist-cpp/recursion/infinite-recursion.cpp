/**
 *
 * base-case: When the argument is zero, the function returns immediately, whithout making any recursive calls.
 * this case —— when the function completes without making a recursive —— is called the base case.
 *
 * infinite recursion: A function that calls itself recursively without every reaching the basecase.
 * Eventually an infinite recursion will cause a run-time error.
